# LumiÃ¨re
A **smart ambient light** for your home ðŸ’¡ 

It will detect the lux level of the environment, and then change the brightness and color of the LED accordingly based on **user profile, mood, or routine**. This calculation will be **handled by ML**. Users can also change the settings manually with a remote control; the adjustments will be **logged and learned**.
