# LumiÃ¨re
A **smart ambient light** for your home ðŸ’¡ 

The Sensor Device utilizes sensors such as VEML7700 and BME280 to **monitor ambient conditions like light levels and temperature**, while also incorporating a MAX9814 microphone for **audio input**. The audio input will be sent to Cloud for processing using **speech recognition**. 

The Display Device provides user interaction, featuring an **encoder for brightness control** and a **stepper gauge to indicate current light modes** like work or relax. Together, Lumiere intelligently adjusts lighting based on environmental factors, user preferences, and emotional states, offering a dynamic and responsive lighting experience.
